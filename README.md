- This repository is a submission for the Getting and Cleaning Data course project.
- Dataset : https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
- Files included:
    1. CodeBook.md
    2. run_analysis.R
- CodeBook.md is a data codebook that describes the variables and layout of the data structure.
- run_analysis.R is a script file that prepares the data as per the 5 steps given below (part of the courses' project description) : 
    1. It first merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    2. It then extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    3. It then Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
    4. It then appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    5. Finally, from the data set in step 4, it creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each            activity and each subject.
